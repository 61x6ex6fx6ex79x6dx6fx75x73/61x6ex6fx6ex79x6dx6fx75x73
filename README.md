## About me, i guess

Hey im abby, i enjoy working in mostly c++, nodejs and python. I like competive programing, although im a little terrible under pressure. I enjoy the social aspect of programming, i work super well in a team

### Vex Robotics

I developed a uniqe program called "Copycat" that mesusred the controlers actions and saved them to a file, version 1 had some issues, for example i assumed the time bettween controller actions was always 10 milliseconds, in version 2 nicknamed "purrfect copycat" i fixed this issue by messuring the cpu time between controller actions.

In 2018 we won the national champions, in 2019 we won the regional champions and the excelence award (highest possible award at vex)

### Bt young scientist

In 2018 i made a iris tracker that had the ability to controll a laptop to aid people with disabilities, i used a kmeans clustering algoritm to accuratly predict which corner of the screen the user was looking at and zooomed until  the machine could make an accurate click on a spefic area

For this i won a design award and a highly commended award
